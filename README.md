These are the models I created with classmates to classify headlines from the news dataset by Rishabh Misra (https://rishabhmisra.github.io/publications/) at https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset into type categories.

Final3 is a logistic regression model.
GMM-FinalProject is a gaussian mixture model.
Final_Project-LSTM-Final_Model is a long short-term memory-based recurrent neural network.
Final-CNN is a convolutional neural network.
